Hi there,
My name is Rick Galgenbeld. I'm 27 years old and living in Lochem (the Netherlands).
I have work in the technical world for 9 years as service engineer, projectmanager & planner. Since last year I noticed that I'm ready for the next step in my career. In the technical world I've acquainted the world of development. That is something were I want to learn more of!
In the last year I've started a course for HTML/CSS as a solid base. Now I'm currently busy with a base Python and Javascript course!
I hope to find someone here who dare to take on the challenge with me and offer me a job!

Are you in for a challenge?!
